# Inventory_Management_System
This project is used to make an inventory management system. It creates various producers and consumers as threads and uses the concept of semaphores to handle race conditions. In the end, it prints the total expenditure and income of the inventory and its total profit or loss.
The program is written in C and the tech stacks used are:
- unistd.h
- pthread.h
- stdio.h
- semaphore.h
