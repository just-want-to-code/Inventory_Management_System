# Inventory_Management_System
This project is used to make an inventory management system. It creates various producers and consumers as threads and uses the concept of semaphores to handle race conditions. At the end it prints the total expendture and income of the inventory and the total profit or loss of the inventory.
The program is written in C and the tech stacks used are:
- unistd.h
- pthread.h
- stdio.h
- semaphore.h
